🔖  Confession: I have a crush on FastAPI’s little sibling – Typer. 😍

🔖  Have some cool code lying around that might not be important enough to build out a whole app/package for….but that still ought to go fast? Like Fast-API fast? 

🔖  You’re in luck. Typer CLI is a command line application that follows the same design and ideas of FastAPI. It allows you to turn your Python scripts into cool CLI’s, and comes with all the bells and whistles that make FastAPI jingle. 🎅🏻

🔖  I’ve always been a wanna-be pilot, so I thought it would be cool to collect data about the flights that were above my location. 📍

🔖  Here’s how it works. I run a python script on a cron job every 30 minutes collecting FlightRadar 24 API data – then, with the click of a few buttons – whip out my “PyflyCLI”  whenever I hear an F-35 thundering overhead and want to see how fast it's going.🚀

🔖  Since the data I’m using for this app is on a local PostgreSQL database, I set up the app to work with some “sample data” so you can run the app yourself. The satisfaction of watching the progress bar when the app loads is worth git cloning the repo I promise. 😂

🔖  By the way, if you’re obsessed with FastAPI the same way I am, I’d highly recommend you give SQLModel a try. It is a thin layer on top of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy, and it's written by the same author. Needless to say, it's awesome. 🎷

⌨  I would love to get your feedback on the project. Especially the amateur ways I’ve created my deeply nested Pydantic models or used asyncio. Next iteration will be better 😀
